All Android SDK packages need to be synchronized in their versions
since upstream only ever builds the entire SDK together at once.
Since that approach would require a source package of many gigs, the
parts of the SDK are packaged up based on the upstream git
repositories.  Also, the tarball download link from
https://android.googlesource.com provides the only source release from
upstream.
